# Master's Project Repository 

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following main sections:

1. **Notebooks:** This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for training, fine-tuning, and evaluation of the ChatGPT model. It includes detailed explanations of the experimental setup, model configurations, and results.

2. **Src:** The source code for the ChatGPT model is located in this directory. It includes the implementation of the model architecture, training scripts, and utility functions. Comments are provided to enhance code readability.

3. **Data:** Raw and preprocessed datasets used for training and evaluation are stored here. Due to the large size of the training data, only sample datasets are included, and links to the original sources are provided.

4. **Models:** Pre-trained models and model checkpoints are saved in this directory. Instructions on how to load and use the pre-trained models are provided in the respective README files.

5. **Documentation:** Additional documentation, including this README file, is located here. It provides an overview of the project, instructions for replicating experiments, and guidelines for using the ChatGPT model.

## Getting Started

To get started with ChatGPT, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kekele-star/masters-project.git
    cd ChatGPT-Masters-Project
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Explore the provided Jupyter notebooks in the "Notebooks" directory for detailed information on training, fine-tuning, and evaluation.

4. Use the pre-trained models in the "Models" directory for your specific applications. Refer to the README files in that directory for guidance.
