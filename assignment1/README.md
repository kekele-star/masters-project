**Predictive Modeling for Housing Prices**

This project involves building and evaluating predictive models for housing prices using supervised learning techniques. The task aims to predict the target variable 'price' based on various predictor variables related to housing attributes. The project is a part of the AI & Computational MIS course under the supervised learning section, emphasizing prediction-oriented modeling in practical scenarios.

### Introduction
The project revolves around developing a predictive model that estimates the unknown target variable 'price' for new observations based on a training dataset containing explanatory variables like square meters, room count, amenities, location details, and historical data. The evaluation of model performance is based on root mean square error (RMSE) on application data.

### Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Explore, clean, and transform the dataset while ensuring consistency between training and application data.
2. **Model Construction**: Develop predictive models using various techniques like linear regression, tree-based methods, or neural networks.
3. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using RMSE, aiming for minimal error to achieve accurate predictions.
4. **Reproducibility**: Maintain transparency and reproducibility in all steps, from data preprocessing to modeling and evaluation.

### Evaluation Criteria
Evaluation encompasses formal aspects like reproducibility, syntax clarity, and method correctness. Additionally, content accuracy, interpretation quality, and visualizations contribute to the overall assessment. Prediction quality relative to a reference model impacts the grading.

### Dataset Description
- **Target Variable**: 'price'
- **Predictor Variables**: Attributes include square meters, room count, amenities presence, location details (e.g., city code, city part range), construction information (year, basement, attic, garage), and more.

### Guidelines and Recommendations
- Perform data preprocessing, considering outlier handling, transformation, and consistency for both training and application datasets.
- Employ suitable modeling techniques, ensuring model selection, and avoiding overfitting.
- Visualization and interpretation of results contribute to evaluation.

### Evaluation Criteria Overview
Grading encompasses formal aspects, methodological correctness, content accuracy, prediction quality, uniqueness, and adherence to guidelines, ensuring a comprehensive and transparent approach.
