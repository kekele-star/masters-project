# Dash Interactive Scatter Plot

## Overview

This project focuses on creating an interactive scatter plot using Dash, a powerful web framework for building interactive web applications with Python. The objective is to visualize the Iris dataset by plotting Sepal Length against Petal Length, allowing users to explore the data dynamically.
